# Magisk-Fully-Disable

This allows Magisk to be disabled almost of its function.
Disabling magisk system-less root, and hiding all of its contents burden to phone system.
It can provide simple disabling of root if it was not needed, and if the user wants to use it again without flashing again.
It will hide magisk from Google and make it inaccessible for all apps except to the 'Reactivator' app that will reactivate Magisk again.

For now, i was just experimenting it.
Soon there will be a progress.
